# KeePass-LinuxLauncher
This is just a quick script I whipped up to automate installing dependencies for and launching KeePass portable in Debian-Based distros.

### Installation
Just copy this to the same folder as your KeePass.exe portable file, then link the file anywhere such as your desktop.  It will detect and resolve the link then launch from the correct location.
